Delieverables

 1. Copy of Rubric2.docx with your name and ID filled out (do not submit a PDF) ``.\Rubric 2.docx``
 2. Source code. (see ``.\main.py``)
 3. Screen print showing the successful execution of your code or copy and paste the output from a console screen to a Word document and PDF it. ``.\Screenshot.pdf``

Pre-reqs
========
* Python ^3.10

 * It might work on lower versions ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

* I use `poetry`_ as the package manager, all deps are for development only

 * `black`_ for formatting
 * `docutils`_ and `esbonio`_ for reStructuredText files

.. _poetry: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry
.. _black: https://github.com/psf/black
.. _docutils: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/
.. _esbonio: https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio

Run from source
===============
.. code-block::bash
  python3 ./main.py
  # or if you have python aliased/sym-linked to 3.10^
  python ./main.py
  # or use appropriate virtual env
